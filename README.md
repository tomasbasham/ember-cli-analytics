# ember-cli-analytics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomasbasham/ember-cli-analytics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomasbasham/ember-cli-analytics)

An [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) addon to interface with analytics
services and external integrations.

Being able to track what your users are doing provides valuable insights into
how your application is performing. However if you are trying to support
multiple analytics integrations it can quickly become unmanageable.

This addon provides a simple `analytics` service allowing your applications to
support multiple analytics integrations without having to clutter your code
base with tracking codes. This addon bundles a series of adapters requiring
that you only have to manage a single API.

This addon is built upon the
[ember-cli-adapter-pattern](https://github.com/tomasbasham/ember-cli-adapter-pattern)
allowing you to easily create your own analytics integration adapters.

## Installation

From within your Ember CLI project directory run:
```
ember install ember-cli-analytics
```

## Usage

This addon implements a service to interface with several analytics integration
by providing an abstract API that hides the implementation details of each
analytics integration adapter.

### Configuration

Before the `analytics` service can be used it first must be configured through
`config/environment`. This allows you to define which of the integrations you
want to make available to your application through the `analytics` service.

##### Configuration Example

```JavaScript
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    analytics: {
      integrations: [
        {
          name: 'Bing',
          config: {
            id: 'XXXXXXX'
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'Facebook',
          config: {
            id: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'GoogleAdwords',
          config: {
            id: 'XXXXXXXXXX',
            label: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'GoogleAnalytics',
          config: {
            id: 'UA-XXXXXXXX-Y',
            remarketing: true,
            ecommerce: true,
            enhancedEcommerce: false,
            set: {
              anonymizeIp: true
            }
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'Mixpanel',
          config: {
            token: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'Optimizely',
          config: {
            id: 'XXXXXXXXXX'
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  };

  return ENV;
};
```

This configures your application to use all 6 adapters bundled with this addon.

#### Options for higher-security implementations

Some higher-security sites may want to prohibit all script-based access to
third-party sites. If this is the case for your site, you might prefer to
download the analytics scripts to the `vendor` location first and then
incorporate them into your ember application via the build process. For
example, for google analytics, you would do the following:

```sh
curl https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js > vendor/google-analytics.js
```

The script can now be loaded as part of the build process by adding a command
to your `ember-cli-build.js` file. For the Google Analytics example, you would
do the following:

```JavaScript
app.import('vendor/google-analytics.js')
```

If you have loaded the scripts into your application via the build process,
`ember-cli-analytics` will _not_ attempt to download them when necessary.

Additionally under the `analytics` configuration key, it is also possible to
set an option `limitRouteInformation`. Some higher-security sites may have
sensitive information embedded in their routes such as email addresses or
invitation codes which should not be leaked to any third-parties. If you set
`limitRouteInformation` to `true`, then `ember-cli-analytics` will only send
the current route name to an analytics service rather than the entire URL.

##### limitRouteInformation Example

```JavaScript
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    analytics: {
      options: {
        limitRouteInformation: true,
      },
      integrations: [
        ...
      ]
    }
  };
};
```

#### Integrations

The integrations array takes a series of objects defining the configuration of
each adapter. This is a requirement of
[ember-cli-adapter-pattern](https://github.com/tomasbasham/ember-cli-adapter-pattern)
where each object may take an additional series of key/value pairs. Alongside
the name of each adapter, in pascal case, this addon also requires a
configuration object typically defining the `id` or `token` required to
authenticate with the external service.


### Injection

This addon makes no assumptions about what ember objects you want to make the
`analytics` service available. Therefore in order to make the service available
you need to implement you own injections.

##### Injection Initializer Example

```JavaScript
// app/initializers/analytics.js
export function initialize(application) {
  application.inject('controller', 'analytics', 'service:analytics');
  application.inject('route', 'analytics', 'service:analytics');
};

export default { initialize };
```

This will make the `analytics` service available to all controllers and routes.
It is however unlikely that you will require the service to be injected into
every controller or route of your applications. Therefore it is recommended
that you include the service on a per object basis.

##### Injection Controller Example

```JavaScript
// app/controllers/application.js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import { inject } from '@ember/service';

export default Controller.extend({
  analytics: inject()
});
```

This will create a dependency on the application controller and inject the
`analytics` service into this controller only. This can be repeated across all
objects that need access to the service.

### Analytics Service

The `analytics` service implements an abstract API that currently supports the
following methods:

* `trackPage`
* `trackEvent`
* `trackConversion`
* `identify`
* `alias`

When using this API, by default the service will call the corresponding method
on each of the adapters unless a specific adapter is specified. This means that
if you were to call `trackEvent` on the service, it would in turn call
`trackEvent` on each of the adapters that implement it.

##### All Adapters Example

```JavaScript
// app/controllers/application.js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

import { get } from '@ember/object';
import { inject } from '@ember/service';

export default Controller.extend({
  analytics: inject(),

  actions: {
    playVideo() {
      const analytics = get(this, 'analytics');
      analytics.trackEvent({ action: 'videoPlayed' });
    }
  }
});
```

This is great behaviour if you have setup multiple analytics integrations in
`config/environment` and is a consequence of the
[ember-cli-adapter-pattern](https://github.com/tomasbasham/ember-cli-adapter-pattern).
However if you only want to send events to a single analytics integration you
must specify its name.

##### Single Adapter Example

```JavaScript
// app/controllers/application.js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

import { get } from '@ember/object';
import { inject } from '@ember/service';

export default Controller.extend({
  analytics: inject(),

  actions: {
    playVideo() {
      const analytics = get(this, 'analytics');
      analytics.trackEvent('Mixpanel', { action: 'videoPlayed' });
    }
  }
});
```

This will only send the event to the `Mixpanel` adapter.

### Trackable Mixin

To track page views this addon provides a `trackable` mixin. This mixin should
be used to augment the ember router and will invoke the `trackPage` method on
each of the configured adapters.

##### Trackable Example

```JavaScript
// app/router.js
import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router';
import Trackable from 'ember-cli-analytics/mixins/trackable';
import config from './config/environment';

const Router = EmberRouter.extend(Trackable, {
  location: config.locationType,
  rootURL: config.rootURL
});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('index');
});

export default Router;
```

### Writing custom integrations

For writing your own analytics integration (e.g. for calling a tracking pixel), extend from the base integration
and implement the functions you want to supply.

```Javascript
import Base from 'ember-cli-analytics/integrations/base';

export default Base.extend({

  trackConversion(options = {}) {
    ...
  },

  trackEvent(options = {}) {
    ...
  }
});
```

Then create an initializer to register your integration to the application container, under the `ember-cli-analytics@integration` factory key.

```Javascript
import CustomIntegration from '../analytics-integrations/custom-integration';
export function initialize(application) {

  application.register('ember-cli-analytics@integration:custom-integration', CustomIntegration);
}

export default {
  name: 'analytics-integrations',
  initialize
};

```
